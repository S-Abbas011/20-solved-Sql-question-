```SQL
Select c.customer_name, p.product_name, s.quantity 
from customer as c 
join sales as s 
on c.customer_id = s.customer_id 
join product as p
on s.product_id = p.product_id 
```

## 2.Find total sales amount per product category.
```SQL
select p.category, sum(s.sales) from product as p 
join sales as s 
on p.product_id= s.product_id 
group by p.category
